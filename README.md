# KADA Tech Summit 2022 (Module 1: Capstone Project)

> This capstone project shows a web-platform built 
> based on an online website for a [conference](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) 
> (check lisense below for more info). Some design guidelines were provided to create the website, 
> but the content was personalized, i.e., instead of a conference, 
> a website for the tech summit (KADA Tech Summit 2022) was created.

## Design Choice
Programming related technologies is rapidly growing in Nigeria. 
Tech professionals love to convene together in a gathering to 
talk about technology, tech future, innovations, challenges 
and also learn new things.

Tech summits offer such amazing platform. This project was created 
as a build of what could be a tech summit in Kaduna State Nigeria.
Kaduna State is growing to become the technological hub of the northern 
region of Nigeria. This project is a creation of what could possibly be 
the summit website called the **KADA TECH SUMMIT 2022**.
